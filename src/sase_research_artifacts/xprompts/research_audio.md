Narrate a research report as an audio edition MP3.

## 1. Find the report

- When invoked with a `@research:` ref, read the report with `sase artifact read`.
- When forked from a swarm lead, narrate the report the lead wrote. If the lead
  produced `<name>__final.md`, use that file even if `<name>.md` has since appeared;
  otherwise use the lead's `<name>.md`. Do not poll or wait for publication. An
  explicit `@research:` input selects exactly that report, including a published
  report.
- The research checkout is `$(sase repo path research --ensure)`.

## 2. Choose the CLI

This plugin never depends on `sase-listen`; the CLI is invoked at runtime only.
Prefer an installed `sase-listen` only when `sase-listen render --help`
advertises `--generated-cover`; otherwise check the `uvx sase-listen` fallback
for the same capability before rendering. If neither supports
`--generated-cover`, report the upgrade requirement through the normal
`audio.ok=false` handoff and complete so the linker can publish. Do not silently drop the option. Capability probing requires no live TTS.

## 3. Write or reuse the script

The script is `<stem>_narration.md` next to the report, with `__final` stripped from
the stem, following the `research_image.md` stem rule (so `topic__final.md` becomes
`topic_narration.md`; other stems are unchanged). Create it without overwrite.

- If it exists and `rewrite` is false, reuse it: an existing script is reused
  unless direct `#research/audio(..., rewrite=true)` is requested. These
  edition defaults govern newly authored scripts.
- Otherwise run `sase-listen guide --edition {{ edition }}` and write the script
  following it exactly, with `source`, `source_blob`, `date`, `kind: research`, and
  `edition: {{ edition }}`. Set both `source` and `source_blob` from the selected
  report above, and use that same report for `lint --source`. Omit `cover` in
  newly authored scripts; the render uses a generated title card.
- Reused scripts retain their narration and metadata; the
  `sase-listen render --generated-cover` option overrides any existing artwork,
  including `cover` frontmatter or a sibling `<stem>_infographic.png`. This
  generated-title-card policy applies to direct `#research/audio` invocations
  too. Never poll or wait for the image in this prompt. Do not rerender
  automatically when an image later arrives.
- Run `sase-listen lint <script> --source <report>` (the `lint --source`
  number-fidelity check) until it is clean.

## 4. Render

Render with `sase tool run -- sase-listen render <script> --generated-cover --json`
(the `render --json` single-object stdout contract). If the render approaches
the inline ceiling, hand it to `/sase_monitor` with the same `--generated-cover`
option, and carry that option into any `/sase_monitor` follow-up.

## 5. Deliver

Whichever turn finishes the render, including a `/sase_monitor` follow-up:

1. Register the finished MP3 with
   `sase artifact create -p <audio_path> -k file -l "audio:<episode_id>"`.
   The structured label lets consumers filter exactly; Telegram still
   `sendAudio`s it from ID3 tags, which it reads independently of the label.
2. Publish the handoff variable from `sase-listen render --json`
   (`chapter_count` is `len(chapters)`):

   ```
   sase var set audio --json --value-file - <<'JSON'
   {
     "ok": true,
     "episode_id": "<episode_id>",
     "title": "<title>",
     "edition": "<edition>",
     "duration_s": <duration_s>,
     "chapter_count": <chapter_count>,
     "script": "<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>_narration.md",
     "audio_path": "<audio_path>",
     "published": <published>
   }
   JSON
   ```

## 6. Report

Report the duration, chapters, approximate cost, and whether it was published to the
feed.

On a render failure, run
`sase var set audio --json --value '{"ok": false, "error": "<code>: <message>"}'`,
register no artifact, report the error code and hint, never switch narrators, and
complete normally so the linker can publish without a listen card.
