  Propose validated Mermaid diagrams that answer named reader questions about a

---

Answer named reader questions with a few validated Mermaid figures for the lead's
research report, writing them to a companion manifest for the swarm linker to place.
The linker is the only publisher: you propose, it places or omits.

## 1. Scope and source

- Never edit the report, never write a report of your own, and create no other file in
  the research checkout (`$(sase repo path research --ensure)`). Keep scratch files in a
  fresh `mktemp -d` directory outside it.
- Read the report once with `sase artifact read` on the registered lead entry listed
  above (its `ref`, or its `research:` label), redirecting the output to a scratch copy.
  Never work from memory or the forked conversation alone.
- If no registered lead report is listed, propose nothing and set `status: failed` with
  that reason (step 8).
- If this prompt also asked for an infographic, finish it first. It is the overview,
  and its panels are candidate hints for your figures, not the frame (step 2).

## 2. Find candidates

The infographic, when this prompt asked for one, comes first: it is the overview.
Its panels are candidate hints, not the frame. Each panel suggests where a reader
question might need a picture, but no figure has to open a panel, and a strong
candidate can come straight from a report section the infographic never touched.

Before deciding anything, write a candidate list in your scratch directory. Cover
each `##` section of the report, and each infographic panel when one exists:

- For each section or panel, name the reader question a picture answers faster than prose.
  Also record the report passages that hold the answer, and the diagram type that fits,
  per the guide's "Choose the type from the content's shape" section. With no
  infographic in this prompt, use each report section that describes a mechanism
  instead.
- Add any mechanism the report explains at length that the infographic left out
  entirely.

Pictures earn their place by showing order, branching, state, ownership, or before
versus after.

## 3. Decide

Judge every candidate, then propose each one that passes, best first, within the cap below.
Zero is right when no reader question survives: zero figures for a survey is a success.
Never reach zero just because the infographic already covers a topic.

A candidate passes when all of these hold:

- it answers a named reader question, and a reader would grasp that answer faster
  from the picture than from the prose;
- it shows order, branching, state, ownership, or before versus after: a flow, a
  state lifecycle, an exchange between actors over time, a dependency structure, a
  phased plan, or a today-versus-proposed pair;
- every box, arrow, and label restates something the report says;
- it does not repeat a Mermaid diagram already in the report, a table, or a short list
  that already shows every step, branch, and condition the diagram would draw. Never turn a table into a diagram.

Reject anything one sentence already explains, short linear chains, refresh or
recompute fan-ins, and repeats of an existing diagram, table, or list.

Rank passing candidates in this order: what the bottom line depends on first, then
today versus proposed, then failure and fallback paths, then drill-downs. Prefer
candidates that answer different reader questions over two views of one question.
When a candidate is too big for one figure, scope it to its most decision-relevant
part, such as the go/no-go rule or the failure path, and scope the caption to that
part. Do not drop the candidate.

Propose at most three diagrams for most reports. A complex report may warrant up to five:
one that explains four or more distinct mechanisms in separate `##` sections, such as an architecture, a protocol, a migration, or a multi-phase plan.
Propose a fourth or fifth diagram only when it passes every test above, answers a reader question no higher-ranked proposal covers, and anchors in a `##` section that holds no other proposal (step 6).
Five is a ceiling, not a target: never lower the bar, split one diagram into two, or add one to reach a count.
A passing candidate the cap leaves out is reported as over the cap (step 8).

## 4. Draw

Draw every diagram by the Mermaid diagram guide below, which governs this step: its
"Make the figure stand alone" section for titles, labels, and edges, its "Fit the PDF
page" section for size, and its "Style with the tested palette" section for colour.
Labels may gloss report terms in plain words but add no facts, and a proposed design
stays marked proposed. Add no actors, steps, numbers, orderings, or causal arrows the
report does not state: trace every box and edge to a sentence in the report.
Conditional wording stays conditional.

## 5. Validate

Put every diagram in a scratch Markdown file with a short paragraph before each one.
Select the CLI once: make a short scratch dir (`mktemp -d` outside the research
checkout; export it as `TMPDIR` so the browser socket path stays short) and write
`<scratch>/pdf.json` with the guide's PDF-mirroring config. Probe the pinned
`npx -y -p @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli@12.0.0 mmdc` first, then fall back to a global
`mmdc`.
A form is usable only if this smoke render exits 0 and writes `probe.svg`:

```sh
printf 'flowchart TD\n  A["ok"]\n' > <scratch>/probe.mmd
<mmdc> -i <scratch>/probe.mmd -o <scratch>/probe.svg
```

A failed probe means that checker form is unavailable, not that a diagram is bad. If a
probe fails only because Chrome cannot start its sandbox (common as root or in
containers), retry once with `-p <scratch>/puppeteer.json` holding
`{"args": ["--no-sandbox"]}`, and keep that flag for the real check. Record
`<mmdc> --version`.

Render, look at, and revise each figure as the guide's "Render, look, and revise"
section says: at most two look rounds, then drop the figure.

Run the batch check with the PDF-mirroring config:

```sh
<mmdc> -c <scratch>/pdf.json -i <scratch>/check.md -o <scratch>/check_render.md
```

The check passes only when the command exits 0, its output says
`Found N mermaid charts in Markdown input` for your N, and
`<scratch>/check_render-1.svg` through `-N.svg` all exist. `mmdc` stops at the first
failing diagram and prints `Parse error on line …` with an excerpt. Fix, simplify, or
drop that diagram and rerun; stop after five rounds. These parse-fix rounds are
distinct from the guide's two look rounds.

Measure each `check_render-K.svg` with the guide's measure command. Fail any figure
below 0.75 fit scale: revise it within the look rounds or drop it. If no form is
usable, propose nothing and set `status: failed` with the reason (step 8).

## 6. Anchor

For each kept diagram, choose an `anchor`: 5-20 words copied verbatim from _one line_ of
a body paragraph or list item in the report. Headings, table rows, code blocks, and
existing Mermaid fences never qualify. Confirm `grep -cF -- '<anchor>' <scratch-copy>`
prints `1`; if no unique anchor exists, drop the diagram.
Anchor each figure in the passage whose question it answers, not in the bottom line or
a summary that condenses it.
If a fourth or fifth diagram's anchor shares a `##` section with another proposal's anchor, drop that diagram (step 3).

## 7. Write the manifest

Write `<stem>.diagrams.md` beside the report, without overwrite, where `<stem>` is the
report's stem with any trailing `__final` removed, following the `#research/image` stem
rule (so `topic__final.md` becomes `topic.diagrams.md`). If it already exists, stop
diagram work, register nothing, and set `status: failed` naming the collision (step 8).
Write no file when no diagram survived.

Keep all metadata in the body, never in frontmatter: `sase artifact read` strips YAML
frontmatter. Use no local paths and no `file:` refs; the research repo is public.

# Diagram proposals: <report title>

Proposals for the swarm linker, not a report. Each diagram restates only what the source
report says.

```yaml
source: research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md
producer: <this agent's name>
check: "mmdc 12.0.0 with the PDF-mirroring config rendered 1 of 1 Mermaid diagrams"
```

## publication-order

```yaml
anchor: |-
  the linker publishes the canonical report only after every companion finishes.
question: |-
  When does the linker publish the canonical report?
illustrates: |-
  The linker waits for every companion agent because the PDF hook fires once, on the
  ADD of name.md.
caption: The linker publishes once, after the lead and image agents finish.
review: "383x438 px, fit 100%; measured with the guide command; 1 round"
```

- `source` is the report's `research:` label, `producer` is your agent name, and `check`
  records the CLI version and chart count from the passing run, plus that the
  PDF-mirroring config was used.
- Each `## <id>` is a unique slug of lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; the linker
  publishes the diagram under the anchor `figure-<id>`. `anchor` is a YAML literal block,
  so backticks and quotes copy exactly. `question` is the reader question the figure
  answers. `illustrates` is one sentence in the report's own terms stating the point
  the diagram makes and what the figure lets a reader see; the linker also builds the figure's in-text reference sentence from it.
  `caption` is the takeaway assertion, at most about 25 words, with no figure number.
  `review` is your audit note: the measured size and fit scale, how the question and look checks went, and the revision rounds;
  the linker never copies `question` or `review` into the report.
- Each `mermaid` fence is byte-identical to the source that passed the check; rerun the
  check after any edit.

## 8. Register and report

- When a manifest exists, register it without `--move`:
  `sase artifact create -p "<abs-path>" -l "diagrams:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<stem>.diagrams.md"`.
  The `diagrams:` label keeps it out of every `research:` listing.
- Then always set the `diagrams` variable, including when you proposed nothing. A missing
  variable means unknown or failed, never "considered and declined". It never carries
  Mermaid bodies. On `ready` and `none`, `considered` is how many candidates
  you judged. `failed` may omit it:

  ```sh
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "ready", "count": 2, "considered": 4, "manifest": "<YYYYMM>/<name>/<stem>.diagrams.md", "source_ref": "<lead ref>"}'
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "none", "count": 0, "considered": 3, "reason": "Survey of five naming options; no reader question needs a picture."}'
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "failed", "count": 0, "reason": "Mermaid CLI (mmdc) unavailable on this host"}'
  ```

- A diagram failure never fails this agent. Finish normally so the linker can publish.
  In the final response, list every candidate with its verdict and its reader question:
  proposed, rejected with a reason, or over the cap. A `none` reason names the candidates considered and why each one
  failed.
